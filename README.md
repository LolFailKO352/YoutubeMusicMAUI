A modern, fast, and unofficial Melodium client built on the [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui) platform. This application brings the best of Melodium straight to your desktop using a native interface, improved music recommendation algorithms, and deep system integration.

- **🎨 Modern UI/UX**: Native design inspired by Windows 11 / WinUI 3. Fully responsive layout that adapts to the window size, with support for automatic switching between Light and Dark mode.
- **🌍 Full Localization**: Built-in translation engine that translates the entire application on the fly for non-native users.
- **⚙️ System Integration**: The app runs in the system tray menu with quick playback controls (Play/Pause), allowing you to control music without having to open the app window.

## 🎚️ How to install

To install application download .zip file from Releases tab unzip it and run Melodium.msi.

## 🔐 How Login Works

The application uses a secure built-in browser window (WebView) to allow you to log in directly via Google/YouTube. After a successful login, the app securely retrieves "session cookies" in the background. Thanks to them, it gains access to your personal library and can generate personalized recommendations. This approach fully bypasses the need for an official (and often paid) API key.
